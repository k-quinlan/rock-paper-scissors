This is the odin rock paper scissors project for javascript.  

Things learned:
- Throwing and catching exceptions
- Text validation and input cleansing
- Switch for multiple cases
- Maths random function


Things to do:
- Add css to make game visual
- Replace prompt and alert with on screen elements
- Error checking for null



For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.


Button - on select, move to left, bring up PC, cycle through, land on random - winner, loser, tie animation.
Winner at 5 points - points tracker at bottom (9 spaces) - track from either side - first fill bar to middle
    animation transition bar grow.
